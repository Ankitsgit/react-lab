### **Props as the Starting Point**
In React, data is commonly passed from parent components to their children using **props**. This mechanism allows data to flow down the component tree efficiently when working with simple structures.

### **The Problem of Nested Components**
As React applications grow, they tend to have deeply nested component structures. This introduces the challenge of **prop drilling**, where data must be passed through multiple intermediate components that do not use the data themselves but only serve as conduits.

### **Illustrating Prop Drilling**
For example, an `App` component passes a `username` prop to a `Card` component. Initially, this is simple. However, if the `App` contains a `Dashboard`, which has a `LeftSidebar`, a `RightSidebar`, a `Top` component, and finally the `Card`, then the `username` prop needs to be manually forwarded through each intermediate component, making the code:

- **Inefficient**: Components receive props they do not use.
- **Unmaintainable**: Making changes requires updating multiple components.
- **Error-prone**: Increased complexity raises the risk of mistakes during refactoring.

## **Context API as a Solution to Prop Drilling**
React’s **Context API** provides a way to share data across components without manually passing props through every level of the component tree. It enables global state management for specific parts of an application.

### **Steps to Using Context API**
#### **1. Creating a Context**
```js
const UserContext = React.createContext();
```
This creates a context object that can be used to provide and consume data.

#### **2. Context Object Components**
The context object contains:
- **Provider**: Supplies data to components.
- **Consumer** (legacy) or **useContext Hook** (modern approach): Retrieves data from the provider.

#### **3. Using a Provider**
The `Provider` component wraps a section of the component tree and provides a **value** prop containing data to be shared.
```js
<UserContext.Provider value={{ user, setUser }}>
    <SomeChildComponent />
</UserContext.Provider>
```

#### **4. Consuming Context with useContext Hook**
Components can access the provided data without receiving it via props.
```js
const { user } = useContext(UserContext);
```
This eliminates prop drilling, as deeply nested components can directly access shared state.

## **Alternatives to Context API**
While Context API solves prop drilling, more robust state management libraries exist for complex applications:

### **1. Redux**
- Standalone state management library following a strict unidirectional data flow.
- Uses a global **store**, **actions**, and **reducers**.
- React applications integrate Redux via `react-redux`.

### **2. Redux Toolkit (RTK)**
- Simplifies Redux by reducing boilerplate code.
- Encourages best practices for state management.

### **3. Zustand**
- A lightweight state management library with a simpler API than Redux.
- Ideal for small to medium-scale projects.

### **4. JustStand**
- Another easy-to-use state management library (less commonly mentioned).

### **5. Context API’s Role**
Context API provides a foundational understanding for transitioning to advanced state management solutions.

## **Project 1: Basic Theme Toggler**
This project demonstrates how to implement a **light/dark theme** toggle using the Context API.

### **1. Creating a Theme Context**
```js
const ThemeContext = React.createContext();
```

### **2. Creating a Provider**
A `ThemeContextProvider` component manages theme state and functions.
```js
const ThemeContextProvider = ({ children }) => {
    const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");
    return (
        <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
            {children}
        </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
};
```

### **3. Wrapping the Application**
```js
<ThemeContextProvider>
    <App />
</ThemeContextProvider>
```

### **4. Consuming the Context**
```js
const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);
```
The `Login` and `Profile` components use `useContext` to access and modify the theme.

## **Global Variables vs. Context API**

### **Why Not Use Global JavaScript Variables?**

#### **1. Lack of Reactivity**
React relies on **state changes** to trigger re-renders. Global variables do not notify React about updates, leading to UI inconsistencies.

#### **2. Uncontrolled Updates**
Any part of the application can modify global variables, making debugging difficult.

#### **3. Context API’s Controlled Updates**
With Context API, updates are managed centrally, ensuring components re-render when necessary.
